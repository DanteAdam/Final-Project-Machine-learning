### Exploring Optimizer Methods for Stock Prediction with Neural Networks
This project focuses on researching and comparing various optimizer methods used in training machine learning models for stock price prediction. We will implement and evaluate the performance of different neural network architectures, including Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in conjunction with different optimizer algorithms.

The project aims to:

* Investigate the impact of different optimizer methods on the training process and prediction accuracy.
* Compare the performance of various neural network architectures for stock prediction.
* Identify the most effective combination of optimizer and network architecture for the specific task of stock price forecasting.
* 
Through this project, we will gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of different optimizer methods and neural network architectures for stock prediction. This will contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient models for financial forecasting.
